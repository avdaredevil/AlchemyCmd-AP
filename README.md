AlchemyCmd-AP
=============

Alchemy API powershell wrapper that allows for console based querying on [Natural Language, Semantic Analysis, and lots more]. Very good for automating Natural Language operations in windows languages.
I am not affiliated with Alchemy-API [This is simply a wrapper for their services]
